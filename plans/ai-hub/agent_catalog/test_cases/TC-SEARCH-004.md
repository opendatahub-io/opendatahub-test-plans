# TC-SEARCH-004: Combined search and filter narrows results

**Objective**: Verify that the `q` keyword search parameter works
correctly in combination with the `filterQuery` parameter.

**Test Steps**:
1. Send GET request to `/api/agent_catalog/v1alpha1/agents` with
   `q=agent&filterQuery=framework = "langgraph"`
2. Verify that results match both the keyword and filter criteria

**Expected Results**:
- Response status is HTTP 200
- All returned agents match the keyword `agent` in a searchable field
  AND have framework equal to `langgraph`
- The combined result is the intersection of both filters
- `size` is less than or equal to either filter applied individually

**Test Data**:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  "${CATALOG_ROUTE}/api/agent_catalog/v1alpha1/agents?q=agent&filterQuery=framework%20%3D%20%22langgraph%22"
```

**Notes**: To be filled later in the process.
