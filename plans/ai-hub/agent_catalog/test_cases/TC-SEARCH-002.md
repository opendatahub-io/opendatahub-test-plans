# TC-SEARCH-002: Name filter with LIKE matching

**Objective**: Verify that the `name` query parameter performs SQL LIKE
matching on agent names.

**Test Steps**:
1. Send GET request to `/api/agent_catalog/v1alpha1/agents` with
   `name=react`
2. Verify that only agents whose name contains "react" are returned

**Expected Results**:
- Response status is HTTP 200
- All returned agent names contain the substring `react`
- The name parameter behaves as a LIKE filter (implicit `%name%`
  wildcards)
- Agents whose names do not contain the substring are excluded

**Test Data**:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  "${CATALOG_ROUTE}/api/agent_catalog/v1alpha1/agents?name=react"
```

**Notes**: To be filled later in the process.
