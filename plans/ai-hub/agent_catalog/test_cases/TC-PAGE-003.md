# TC-PAGE-003: Order by CREATE_TIME descending sorts newest first

**Objective**: Verify that the `orderBy=CREATE_TIME` with
`sortOrder=DESC` parameters return agents sorted by creation time with
newest agents first.

**Test Steps**:
1. Send GET request to `/api/agent_catalog/v1alpha1/agents` with
   `orderBy=CREATE_TIME&sortOrder=DESC`
2. Verify the returned agents are in descending order by creation
   timestamp

**Expected Results**:
- Response status is HTTP 200
- Agent `createTimeSinceEpoch` values are in descending order
- The first agent in the list has the most recent creation timestamp

**Test Data**:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  "${CATALOG_ROUTE}/api/agent_catalog/v1alpha1/agents?orderBy=CREATE_TIME&sortOrder=DESC" \
  | jq '[.items[].createTimeSinceEpoch]'
```

**Notes**: To be filled later in the process.
