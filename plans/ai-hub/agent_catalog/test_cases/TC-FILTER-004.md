# TC-FILTER-004: filterQuery with ILIKE operator performs case-insensitive matching

**Objective**: Verify that the filterQuery parameter with the `ILIKE`
operator performs case-insensitive partial string matching.

**Test Steps**:
1. Send GET request to `/api/agent_catalog/v1alpha1/agents` with
   `filterQuery=name ILIKE "%REACT%"`
2. Verify that agents whose name contains "react" in any case are returned

**Expected Results**:
- Response status is HTTP 200
- Returned agents include names containing `react`, `React`, `REACT`,
  or any mixed case
- ILIKE behaves identically to LIKE except for case sensitivity

**Test Data**:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  "${CATALOG_ROUTE}/api/agent_catalog/v1alpha1/agents?filterQuery=name%20ILIKE%20%22%25REACT%25%22"
```

**Notes**: To be filled later in the process.
